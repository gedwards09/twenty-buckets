    "## The Twenty-Number Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "The Twenty-Number challenge is a game where a player selects integers uniformly at random (typically from 1 to 1,000) which must be placed into a fixed number of \"buckets\" (typically twenty) such that after each turn the numbers are placed in increasing order. If the player cannot place the drawn number into any bucket such that the numbers are in increasing order then the player's turn is over.\n",

    "#### Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Define $M$ to be the maximum of the range of integers (typically $M = 1000$). We let $n$ be the total number of buckets (typically $n=20$). We will always assume $n << M$.\n",

    "For a random variable $X$, we write $X \\sim \\mathscr U \\left \\{ A, B \\right \\}$ for a uniformly random selected $\\textit{integer}$ in the range $A$ to $B$, inclusive ([Wikipedia: Discrete Uniform Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_uniform_distribution)). We write $X \\sim U \\left[a,b\\right]$ for a uniformly random continuous variable in $[a,b]$ ([Wikipedia: Continuous Uniform Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_uniform_distribution)).\n",

    "### The Naive Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The first strategy we'll consider is called the naive strategy. It serves as a first approximation at a solution and will be a benchmark against which we can compare more complicated strategies. The strategy is based on the observation that:\n",
    "\n",
    "Claim: Let $X_1,\\ldots,X_n$ be random variables selected independently, uniformly at random, on the interval $\\left[0,1\\right]$ (that is, $X_1,\\ldots,X_n \\sim U \\left [ 0 , 1 \\right ]$). Then with probability 1, the $X_i$ are distinct, and we can place them in increasing order. If $Y_i$ is the $i$-th random variable in increasing order, then the expected value of $Y_i$ is given by $$\\mathbb E \\left [ Y_i \\right ] = \\frac i {n+1}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, given $n$ random numbers between zero and one, on average, the $i$-th largest number is about $\\frac i {n+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this claim, and the observation that if $X \\sim \\mathscr U \\{1, M\\}$, then $\\frac 1 {M+1} X$ is approximately uniformly distributed (specifically, converges in distribution as $M \\to \\infty$ ([Wikipedia: Convergence in Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_of_random_variables#Convergence_in_distribution))), we conclude that if we select integers $X_1,\\ldots,X_n \\sim \\mathscr{U} \\left \\{ 1 , M \\right\\}$, then on average the $i$-th largest value, $Y_i$, is approximately $Y_i \\approx (M + 1) \\frac {i}{n+1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we do win the Twenty-Number Challenge having drawn random variables $X_1,\\ldots,X_n$, then if one of those random variables (say, the first one) draws value $X_1 = x$, then that variable is most likely to be the $i$-th largest of the $n$ on average where $i$ is the closest index to $\\frac {n+1}{M+1} x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalently, $i$ is the index such that $i \\leq \\frac {n+1}{M+1} x + \\frac 1 2 < i + 1$, we write $i = \\lfloor \\frac {n+1}{M+1}x + \\frac 1 2 \\rfloor$ (notation: [Wikipedia: Floor Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions))\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this we arrive at the following basic strategy:\n",
    "If we draw random integer $X = x$, we should place it as close to index $i$ ."
